## Samples

Samples of my work, listed by companies where I worked.

### Specialized Bicycle Components

#### [WeChat Authentication Guide](/examples/sbc_auth_we_chat/)

A guide on how to authenticate with Specialized's Identity Service using WeChat. To write this guide, I worked closely with the java developer responsible for creating the workflow, as well as assisting with testing using Postman and WeChat on Android. This guide was included as part of a catalogue of recipes contained within an MkDocs project and deployed to the Specialized Admin Portal.

`Markdown` `MkDocs` `WeChat` `Authentication`

#### [Login API Endpoint Documentation](/examples/sbc_auth_login)

A detailed guide to using the login API endpoint for Specialized's Identity Service. Originally included in a page documenting all authenticated-related endpoints in the Identity Service. The source was written as a standalone, re-usable document that could be called using a Jinja2 include directive. This document was of an MkDocs project and deployed to the Specialized Admin Portal. All endpoint documentation in the suite followed this pattern.

*Note: this document has been altered from the origin (MkDocs Python-flavoured Markdown) for compatibility with Hugo. Sections have been converted from tabs to headings.*
