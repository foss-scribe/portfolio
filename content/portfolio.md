My portfolio is coming soon. This site was created in late January 2023 after I left Specialized when the company downsized its workforce, so I'm still finding my feet and gathering examples for publication.

As most of my work is considered commercial in confidence and proprietary, I'm working on ways of sharing a selection from previous roles. Until then, examples will be provided upon request at my discretion during appropriate stages of recruitment.
