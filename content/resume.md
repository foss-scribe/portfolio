## Professional Experience

### Technical Writer, Specialized Bicycle Components, 2020-2023

As Technical Document Writer, I worked within Specialized's Global Technology Team, providing technical writing, DevOps and customer API support. I worked daily with engineers, product managers, customer support, and third-party developers.

My primary responsibility was to write, edit, maintain and deploy an extensive suite of API documentation, including Zone 5 Cloud/Today's Plan, Bike Registration Service, Bike Settings Service, Events Service, Point of Sale Service, and the Identity Service for deployment into the People's Republic of China. As the position was greenfield, I developed a first-class technical publishing system using Markdown, MkDocs, GIT, and an automated CI/CD publishing process powered by Python and Bash with deployment to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

I supported Today's Plan's customers daily, including elite national cycling teams, coaches and training companies. I consulted with and assisted their technical and non-technical personnel in building API integrations. Part of this support included writing integration code in Python, JavaScript, PHP (WordPress plugin), and Shopify (HTML, Liquid and JavaScript), which they could drop into their systems.

Additionally, I supported Specialized engineering teams through API testing and developing test suites in Postman. I also provided ongoing operational assistance to Specialized's DevOps team, particularly for access management and roles assignment across Specialized's engineering teams.
