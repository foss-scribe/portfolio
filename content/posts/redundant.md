Well, what a way to start 2023 — by being made redundant for the first time in my professional career, which has spanned almost 20 years. To say I felt like I was kicked in the teeth when I received the news is an understatement. Until last Thursday, I worked as a technical writer for Specialized (a manufacturer of high-end bicycles) for over two years. Then, at 9 am, I was laid off along with half my team in a cull of 8% of the workforce — mainly from the technology teams to which I belonged. In my time there, I built the role from nothing to a world-class suite documenting no less than six API services, all managed with Git and published automatically using CI/CD principles and a lot of Python — all of which I wrote myself.

Yeah, that hurts, but there’s nothing I can do about it except swallow my pride, cash in my redundancy entitlements, and move on with my life…

…and yet, life is never that simple.

Losing my job has forced me to stop and take stock. While I’m in no immediate financial danger, I have a mortgage to pay and kids to feed. At some point, I’ll have to dust off my resume, update my LinkedIn profile and reenter the job market. Hopefully, I’ll find something that pays well and lets me work from home, but the economy differs significantly from when I started working for Specialized.

I confess, there’s a part of me that wants and needs to take a breather. Although I love my career, it’s only one facet of my being. For 20 years, my professional life has forced me by necessity to push my creative interests to the back of the queue. Suddenly, I have an abundance of time and am leery about shackling my wagon to another unfeeling corporation, at least for now.

So, in the meantime, I'll emerge from the shadow of my [nom de plume](https://chrisross.net), and perhaps do a little blogging about technical writing while I decide what my next move should be.
