I'm Chris, a senior technical writer and trainer, and this is my professional portfolio and blog.

I have a high degree of technical and domain-specific knowledge, producing `docs as code` using Markdown and Asciidoc long before it was common practice.

From the UK originally, I grew up and was educated in Australia. An avid traveller in my 20s, I lived and worked in Bristol, England but returned to Australia to settle down. Today, I live in Melbourne with my wife and three children.


## Elsewhere

You can find some of my writing on [Medium](https://technicalprose.medium.com) where I blog about topics that tickle my creative and technical interests.
